Whenever an experiment needs to be executed, this file is run. In this file, the user
can provide which environment to run the experiment in. In addition,
the user can provide arguments to fine-tune the experiment, such as whether s/he wants to
run a Q-Table or a neural network implementation. Various hyperparameters such as number of games,
gamma, etc. are also available. The corresponding file from /envs/ is grabbed and ran.
