Creation Date: 2021-01-01

This file houses any utility functions that is filled as needed.
Most notable are those functions which can make the debugging
process easier. Other functions that can't exactly fall into
any other category can also be placed here. For example, when
I created this file, the intention was to place the code to generate
the GIFs for when a game is played.
